= Overview

Using a Hub OCPv4 Cluster for mirroring Openshift release and catalog content for building "Spoke" OCPv4 clusters.

= Issues

* Existing non tech preview mirror tooling as of 26 May 2022 a little chicken and egg
** A lot of work needed to determine where to start from channel/csv wise
** Almost have to deploy a cluster to determine what is really needed to be safe

* Full catalog mirror download can resolve some issues with removing the "chicken and egg" problem but still has downsides
** You end up mirroring content that you do not need old stuff and new stuff
** Seemed to be fairly sequential, and with low bandwdith outbound connection takes a super long time (days)
*** not great when you might need to make a an update for a critical vulnerability

* Partial mirror with existing tooling not super great
** Download this data, then filter, then mirror a lot of extra work
** Potential for missing dependencies
*** Operators aligned to this repo but need image out another repo
*** odf operator now kicks off other operators so if you only partial mirrored odf you're probably missing other images
** Has same problem as full catalog mirror you better be doing this daily as to not miss images
*** operators update in staging from one csv to the next sometimes they can skip but each stage may want a different image
**** this right here is a good place for people to fall on their face 

* Automated Operator Approval which infers rollout sounds great but also sounds dangerous
** Prefer to set approval to false and control when automated operator updates happen (after downstream testing)

= Background

* started looking at this during 4u9 and into 4u10
** first did full mirror took forever, brute force, customer slow network no excuses for them but reality for me
** went back to partial mirror and brute forced build, more partial mirror as post install deploys finding missing images
* pulled back and dug into the openshift objects so I could gather an understanding of the issues that I thought I was seeing
** ended up sending email into openshift-sme about these issues and got a good response I think

Let's go over the catalog operator structure

*Catalog Operator Packaging Structure*

* CatalogSource
** packagemanifest
*** Channel 
**** ClusterServiceVersion (csv)
***** CustomResourceDefinition
***** InstallPlan (ip)

*Catalog Operator Deployment Structure*

* CatalogSource
** Subscription
** OperatorGroup (needed in namespace you want to deploy operator to)
*** ClusterServiceVersion
**** InstallPlan
***** Job
****** operator bundle image

= Requirements

* Faster installs and upgrades
** Reduce potential fails due to slow network 
* Removes upstream dependency
* Allows for physically or logically disconnection spoke cluster installations
** Probably best to not let your production deployments have access to the outside world
* Prevent freefall random/automated updates 
** sounds great on paper but risky we have automated operater updates cause outages
* Allow for downstream testing before rolling up to higher environments
* Minimize storage space required for mirrored content

= Design

Hub Cluster Provides Shared Services

* OCPv4 Release Mirror
* OCPv4 Operator Catalog Mirror

= Implementation

== Laptop and or build node setup

* don't shoot me still running fedora 29
** preference would be to have a build node setup running appropriate rhel release

Tools here including disconnected tools (oc-mirror tool and a cooked mirror registry)

* https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads
** Under "Tokens" grab the pull secret 
** https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/clients/ocp/stable/oc-mirror.tar.gz

Create this file with your pull secret
----
[dsulliva@fancy ~]$ cat .docker/config.json
----

*Note:* The cooked registry might be good for a quick disconnected stand up, but think a hub mirror design better long term.

== Interrogate upstream catalog for the operator you need

Start by looking at the available operator catalogs

----
[dsulliva@fancy oc-mirror]$ ./oc-mirror list operators --catalogs --version=4.10
Available OpenShift OperatorHub catalogs:
OpenShift 4.10:
registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.10
registry.redhat.io/redhat/certified-operator-index:v4.10
registry.redhat.io/redhat/community-operator-index:v4.10
----

We want the redhat-operator-index so next list the operators in that index

[dsulliva@fancy oc-mirror]$ ./oc-mirror list operators --catalog=registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.10
